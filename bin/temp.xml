        <p>Peter Bavasi resigned as president of the Cleveland Indians in order to take over as president and chief executive officer of Telerate Sports, a newly formed sports- information service. The Indians said that Dan O'Brien, Joe Klein, Terry Barthelmas and Greg Olson would handle the direction and day-to-day activities of the club. Bavasi, 44, joined the Indians in November 1984. Last season the team had an 84-78 record, its best since 1968, and attendance of 1.47 million, its highest since 1959. Bavasi, the son of Buzzy Bavasi, the former baseball executive, was founding president the Toronto Blue Jays and former general manager of the San Diego Padres.</p>
